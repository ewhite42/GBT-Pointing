# GBT-Pointing

The goal of this repository is to compile and document programs which are currently used to reduce GBT pointing runs and convert them into useable TPOINT file formats. Documentation for these programs can be found here: https://safe.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/GB/PTCS/PointingSoftwareDocs
